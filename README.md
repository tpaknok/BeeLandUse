This is a repository for the manuscript Tsang et al.Â (Submitted). Some
datasets are private thus were not uploaded here. Please refer to
supplementary table S3 of the manuscript and contact the data owners for
the data.

Code required to analyze the diversity data has been uploaded, but note
that the results wont be the same with the manuscript as some private
datasets were not released.

Three data files are available: cleaned_alpha.csv, cleaned_beta.csv, and
cleaned_genus.csv

## Code

In the code folder, there are 5 scripts. Please run the scripts in
numerical order
